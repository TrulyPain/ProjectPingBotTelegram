# How to get started?
To get started follow the steps below:
1. Start by reading the license.
2. Chat with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) on Telegram to get your API-Token.
3. Add the correct info to the bot under DEV VARIABLES in hook.php and customise your bot.
4. Upload the bot to a secure webserver.
5. Go to **https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/setwebhook?url=URL**. Replace 'TOKEN' with your Api-token that you got in step 2. And replace 'URL' with the url to your hook.php.

Now you should be done.

Good luck with your bot.
