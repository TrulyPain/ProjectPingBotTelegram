# This project is archived
I am sorry to announce that I am going to be archiving my GitHub project "Project Ping Bot" due to lack of time and other priorities. This project was an important learning experience for me, but I have reached a point where I need to focus on other things.

I want to thank everyone who has supported me and my project. I have learned a lot from working on "Project Ping Bot" and I am grateful for the interest and encouragement that you all have shown.

If you are currently using "Project Ping Bot" and need support, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I will do my best to provide any assistance I can.

Best,

Jamie Blomerus

# How to get started?
To get started follow the steps below:
1. Start by reading the license.
2. Chat with [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather) on Telegram to get your API-Token.
3. Add the correct info to the bot under DEV VARIABLES in hook.php and customise your bot.
4. Upload the bot to a secure webserver.
5. Go to **https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/setwebhook?url=URL**. Replace 'TOKEN' with your Api-token that you got in step 2. And replace 'URL' with the url to your hook.php.

Now you should be done.

Good luck with your bot.
